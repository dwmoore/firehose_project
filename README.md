# FirehoseProject

Thanks for stopping by! This repo is for a whiteboard project involving linked
lists. For a complete overview of the requirements, please see:

[Reversing a linked list via stack](https://gist.github.com/khundawg/1ee8e9b116b48e784bf3)
and
[Reversing a linked list via mutation](https://gist.github.com/khundawg/b7e475535dd0122ef46f)

Solutions for the above problems are in the
[dm_linked_list_1](https://github.com/khundawg/firehose_project/tree/dm_linked_list_1/lib) and [dm_linked_list_2](https://github.com/khundawg/firehose_project/tree/dm_linked_list_2/lib) branches.

Tests are also available for the
[stack](https://github.com/khundawg/firehose_project/tree/dm_linked_list_1/spec)
and
[mutation](https://github.com/khundawg/firehose_project/tree/dm_linked_list_2/spec) solutions.
